## What is Caching?

It is a process of storing **a copy of data in a faster, temporary storage layer** so that future requests for that data can be served faster without going back to the original, slower source.

**The core problem caching solves**

Every system has a speed mismatch between layers:

CPU Operations: ~1 nanosecond\
RAM Access: ~100 nanoseconds\
SSD Read: ~100 microseconds\
Network DB Query: ~10–100 milliseconds

That means a DB query is 1,000,000x slower than CPU operations.<br>
Caching solves this by absorbing the majority of reads before they reach the DB.

## Why Caching?

* Reduce Latency

  * **Without cache**: User → App → DB → App → User   (~50–100ms) 
  * **With cache**: User → App → Cache → User       (~1–5ms). <br>Improvement: 10x to 100x faster response
* Reduce Database Load

  * **Without cache**: 10,000 req/sec → 10,000 DB queries/sec → DB overwhelmed <br>
  * **With cache** (90% hit rate): 10,000 req/sec → 1,000 DB queries/sec → DB comfortable
* Increase Throughput

  * DB handles:        ~10,000 queries/sec 
  * Redis handles:     ~100,000 queries/sec 
  * Same hardware, 10x more requests served.
* Reduce Cost

  * DB read   = expensive (compute + I/O + licensing)
  * Cache hit = cheap     (pure memory read)
  * At scale: millions of $ saved in infrastructure

## What Data Should You Cache?

Not everything deserves to be cached. Use this framework: <br>

#### Good Candidates for Caching

* Frequently read, rarely written     → Product catalog, user profiles
* Expensive to compute                → Recommendation engine results
* Same result for many users          → Homepage feed, trending topics
* Tolerable if slightly stale         → Social media counts, analytics
* Session data                        → Auth tokens, shopping cart

#### Bad Candidates for Caching

* Highly personalized per request     → Real-time bank balance
* Changes every millisecond           → Stock tick data (sometimes)
* Must always be accurate             → Payment transaction status
* Rarely accessed                     → Historical audit logs
* Very large objects                  → Video files (use CDN instead)

### The Golden Rule

Cache data that is read often, written rarely, and tolerable to be slightly stale.

## The Cache Trade-off Triangle

Every caching decision involves balancing three things:

```markdown
                 SPEED
                   /\
                  /  \
                 /    \
                /______\
        CONSISTENCY    MEMORY

You can optimize for 2, but the 3rd suffers.
```

* **Speed + Memory** → Consistency suffers (stale data risk)
* **Speed + Consistency** → Memory suffers (need more cache to keep everything fresh)
* **Consistency + Memory** → Speed suffers (frequent invalidation = more DB hits)

## Race Condition

```
Thread A (write)          Thread B (read)
─────────────────         ─────────────────
1. Write new value
to DB ✅
                        2. Cache miss →
                          reads OLD value
                          from DB ❌
3. Delete/invalidate
cache entry ✅
                        4. Stores OLD value
                          back in cache ❌
```

> *Cache and DB can never be perfectly in sync because they're updated non-atomically. The right strategy depends on consistency requirements. For eventual consistency, TTL-based expiry is sufficient. For stronger consistency, I'd use explicit invalidation with a distributed lock using Redis SETNX to prevent race conditions during concurrent reads and writes.*

* FIXES:

  * TTL          → eventual consistency, simplest
  * Invalidation → reduces stale window
  * Locks        → strong consistency, most complex
